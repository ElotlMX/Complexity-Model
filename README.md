Repository that contains the code for calculating the entropy rate of a subword language model:

``python main.py --input_directory``

The corpora for the languages mentioned in the article was pre-processed and extracted from:
- [The Parallel Bible Corpus](http://www.christianbentz.de/MLC2019_data.html)
